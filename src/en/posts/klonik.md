This compact yet functional MOC depicts a clone trooper manning a command post at a Republic base. The console, screens, and technical details create a cohesive operational sceneâ€”ready for analyzing data, issuing orders, or coordinating operations in the field. Although compact, the model is designed to fit perfectly as a module for a larger military base. It is a small piece of galactic conflict that works perfectly as part of a larger story.
