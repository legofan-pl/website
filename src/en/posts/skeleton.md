This small but exceptionally evocative MOC transports us to a sandy desert diorama, where the sole protagonist is... the skeleton of a former treasure hunter. With a wine bottle in one hand and a map in the other, he serves as a grim reminder of how greed and the pursuit of legends can undo even the bravest. Small bushes scattered throughout the base and carefully crafted terrain add realism to the scene, and the fine details make the whole thing impressive despite its small size. In short: an atmospheric miniature with a story behind it.
