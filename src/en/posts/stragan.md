This compact yet detail-rich MOC depicts a medieval food stall run by a castle resident. On the stand, you can find appetizing rolls, pieces of meat, and fresh fish — all carefully arranged to capture the atmosphere of an old marketplace. A distinctive feature of the build is the white-and-blue canopy, which brings color and life to the scene. Despite its small size, the model includes many tiny details that catch the eye and invite a closer look at this little snapshot of everyday life in a medieval town.
